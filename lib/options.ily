% Global option handling for openLilyLib
%
% Options are stored in one nested alist
% Managment of that alist is realized through the a-list-access.ily files.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Interface to store and retrieve options from one global option alist.
% The following functions rely on functionality in the
% (oll-core internal alist-access) module

% Global object holding all configuration data of all loaded openLilyLib modules
\newAtree oll-options

% A library can register options (best to be done in the __init__.ily file).
% Later end users can only set registered options, so this is kind of a syntax check.
%
% #1: option path in list or dot notation.
%     The first item should be the library name
% #2: initial value
%     If the user doesn't set the option explicitly this value is assumed

% can be used to avoid warnings when trying to access unregistered options.
% Returns #t or #f

% Set an option.
% Only registered options can be set this way.
% #1: Optional argument <force-set>
%     If set and the option is not registered it initialized
%     instead of being rejected.
% #2: Provide a tree path in dotted or list notation
%     the first item of the path is the library name,
%     followed by an arbitrary path at the library's discretion
% #3: Any Scheme value
